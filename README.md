# Veterinary Clinic DatabaseDesign
In this project, our team read and analyze the Fairbanks Veterinary Clinic Case Study. We played the role of a consultant who has been hired by the client (Fairbanks Veterinary Clinic) to design and create a database for them.

Steps:

1. We analyzed the entire Fairbanks Veterinary Case Study
2. We documented the ENTITIES and ATTRIBUTES we gathered as we learned about how Fairbanks schedules and manages Pet Training Events.

3. As we finished identifying entities and attributes, then we began to design the tables
necessary for the Training Events business area of the database.
4. Once the data model is complete, we generated the DDL (Data Definition Language) to create the database.
5. We Executed our DDL to create the complete database.

6. Then we populated (via SQL INSERT statements) each table in our database with several rows of test data of our own creation:
• Added some Pets 
• Added some Owners 
• Added some Trainers – Including Shey and Marie
• Added some Training Events, coming up during the current month – Including Basic Skills, Walk-Train-Play, Off-Leash Operation

7. We Created and ran queries to show the following:
A list of Owners and Pets showing the owner name, pet name, breed, gender, date of birth
A list of Upcoming Training Events showing the date, time, trainer, event type, owner, pet
